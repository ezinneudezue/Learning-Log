# 2025-12-01 – Today I Learned  

#If you want to maintain control of anything where you use AI - remember to use it to Augment and never abdicate to it.     
I've known this in my core. Especially as I am forced to think of Enterprise scale whenever I think about AI and AI code. 
A lot of this crystalized after I read Josh Anderson's article which I stumbled upon on LInkedIn.

I’m not writing this to give you the ultimate Claude Code playbook that will work forever. The pace of AI tool evolution makes that impossible. What worked last month is outdated today. What I’m documenting here worked (until it didn’t) in September 2025.  
What I’m giving you is something more valuable: a look under the hood at what actually happens when you push these tools to their limits. The features will change. The token limits will grow. The agent systems will get fancier.  
But the fundamental challenges? The context complexity? The non-deterministic behavior? The architectural drift? Those aren’t going away with a feature update. They’re baked into how these systems work.
